Hello CIP people,
This is my final project, which, despite being a small and straightforward project, solves many problems that I usually have regarding productivity.

Sometimes I spend a lot of time playing on Facebook or anywhere else and forget to do some other assignments. So I have created a program that records the time I spend on each program and internet pages so that I can more effectively monitor my time.

That's it, a simple solution for a big problem! :)
